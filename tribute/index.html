      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Kalam's life:</h3>
      <li><strong>1931</strong> - Born in Rameshwaram, India</li>
      <li><strong>1958</strong> - Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
      <li><strong>1982</strong> - Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earned him the nickname "Missile Man." </li>
      <li><strong>1992-1997</strong> -  Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser</li>
      <li><strong>1998</strong> -  1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. </li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country. </li>
